AI METHODS is a start-up born from a research project in Carlos III University of Madrid (UC3M).

## Our Mission
We aim to help organizations, companies and aviation professionals improve their decision-making by accessing the best possible weather information.

## Research Activity

A key component of our solutions is their scientific basis. Hence the importance of our research staff and our scientific activity.

## Solutions

### Earlier Weather Forecast

Uncertainty in weather forecasting will no longer be a problem. The combination of Artificial Intelligence and expertise in ATM and meteorology will allow you to stop using tactical approaches to convective weather and plan real strategies to manage demand capacity.

### Accurate Data

Make better decisions through an algorithm capable of reading over 10 million historical weather records and adding intelligence to them in order to improve the quality of weather forecasts.

### Customized Solution

Access data in a format compatible with your traffic flow management practice, as AI METHODS is fully adaptable to your needs.

### Smart Storm Warning

AI METHODS' Smart Storm Warning system is able to predict storms anytime and anywhere in the world and can be adapted to your models and needs.
